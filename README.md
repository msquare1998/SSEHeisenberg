# Stochastic series expansion algorithm for S=1/2 AFM Heisenberg model
This project reproduces the same algorithm as that in https://physics.bu.edu/~sandvik/programs/ssebasic/ssebasic.html

## Unsafe macro
Of course you can replace all the unsafe blocks in my code with the safe version. I have tested on my MacBook Pro (M1), and found that it would lead to around 5% performance loss. I prefer the safe version actually, which is reassuring (otherwise why don't we use C/C++ instead?), but I upload the unsafe version here for those who need ultimate performance.
